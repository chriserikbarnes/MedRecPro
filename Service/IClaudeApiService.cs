    /// <summary>
    /// Defines the contract for Claude AI API integration services that provide artificial intelligence
    /// capabilities for analyzing and comparing SPL (Structured Product Labeling) medical documents.
    /// This interface enables AI-powered text analysis, data completeness validation, and intelligent
    /// comparison operations critical for medical record processing and pharmaceutical documentation systems.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// The Claude API service serves as the core AI intelligence layer for the MedRecPro comparison system,
    /// leveraging Anthropic's Claude language model to perform sophisticated analysis of medical documents.
    /// This service provides natural language processing capabilities specifically tuned for healthcare
    /// and pharmaceutical documentation requirements.
    /// 
    /// Key capabilities provided through this interface include:
    /// - Intelligent comparison analysis between XML and JSON medical document formats
    /// - Natural language processing for medical terminology and pharmaceutical data
    /// - Structured data extraction from unstructured medical text
    /// - Completeness assessment for regulatory compliance documentation
    /// - Quality assurance validation for medical data transformations
    /// - Contextual understanding of medical document structures and relationships
    /// 
    /// The service integrates with Anthropic's Claude API to provide enterprise-grade AI analysis
    /// while maintaining data security and privacy standards required for medical information processing.
