        Description = $@"
This API provides a REST interface for the OGD SQL Server {environment} environment ({serverName}).
It is designed to manage Structured Product Labeling (SPL) data based on the ICH7 SPL Implementation Guide (December 2023).

## General Information

* **Data Access:** The API utilizes a generic repository pattern (`GenericRepository<T>`) implemented in `MedRecPro.DataAccess` for database operations. It assumes table names match class names and primary keys follow the `[ClassName]ID` naming convention. Dapper is used for object-relational mapping.
* **Data Models:** Data structures corresponding to the database tables (e.g., `Document`, `Organization`) are defined in `MedRecPro.DataModels` (`LabelClasses.cs`).
* **Database Schema:** The underlying database schema is defined in `MedRecPro-TableCreation.sql`.

## API Endpoints

### Documents (`/api/Documents`)

This controller manages `Document` entities, providing CRUD operations based on SPL metadata.

* **`GET /api/Documents`**: Retrieves all Document records.
    * **Response:** `200 OK` - Returns a list of documents.
* **`GET /api/Documents/id`**: Retrieves a specific Document record by its primary key (`DocumentID`).
    * **Parameters:** `id` (integer, path) - The `DocumentID` of the document to retrieve.
    * **Responses:**
        * `200 OK` - Returns the requested document.
        * `404 Not Found` - If the document with the specified ID is not found.
* **`POST /api/Documents`**: Creates a new Document record.
    * **Request Body:** A `Document` object (defined in `LabelClasses.cs`). `DocumentID` should be omitted or 0 as it is auto-generated.
    * **Responses:**
        * `201 Created` - Returns the newly created document, including its assigned `DocumentID`.
        * `400 Bad Request` - If the input document data is invalid.
* **`PUT /api/Documents/id`**: Updates an existing Document record.
    * **Parameters:** `id` (integer, path) - The `DocumentID` of the document to update.
    * **Request Body:** The updated `Document` object. The `DocumentID` in the body must match the `id` in the route.
    * **Responses:**
        * `204 No Content` - If the update was successful.
        * `400 Bad Request` - If the ID in the route doesn't match the ID in the body, or if the data is invalid.
        * `404 Not Found` - If the document with the specified ID is not found.
* **`DELETE /api/Documents/id;`**: Deletes a Document record by its ID.
    * **Parameters:** `id` (integer, path) - The `DocumentID` of the document to delete.
    * **Responses:**
        * `204 No Content` - If the deletion was successful.
        * `404 Not Found` - If the document with the specified ID is not found.

## Database Caching:
The system implements both timer-based and managed caching for database requests to optimize performance.
Retrieving data from cache is significantly faster than querying the database directly.
When you need to ensure fresh data from the database, use the `/REST/API/Utility/ClearManagedCache` endpoint to clear the managed cache before making your request."
